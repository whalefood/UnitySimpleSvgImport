# UnitySimpleSvgImport
A simple importer for svg files to Unity

This is a utility that converts svg files into scriptable objects for use by Unity.  
It uses a "ScriptedImporter" which is technically part of Unity's experimental library, but seems to stable.

This doesn't include any rendering functionality, but I recommend using something like Freya Holm√©r's Shapes library.
